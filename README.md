- 👋 Hi, I’m @niti42
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things that includes domains particularly physics, literature, music, history, programming and DIY electronics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science since I found that it is that one domain where a mind that brances out to various subjects can thrive hopefully!!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science related projects, DIY electronics (arduino, raspberry pi etc.)
- 📫 How to reach me: email - nithishk12@gmail.com
